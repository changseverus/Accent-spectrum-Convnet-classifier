# Accent-spectrum-classification

Speech recognition has been a huge topic of deep learning in recent years, and identifying accents is one of the biggest challenge while buidling speech recognition system. 

In this project, I build a ConvNet classifier to detect three different types of accent using keras, the input takes in a png spectrum image, and return what kinds of accents it predicted to be.
