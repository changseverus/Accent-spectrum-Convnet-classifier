# Accent-spectrum-classification

Speech recognition has been a huge topic of deep learning these years, and identifying accents is one of the big challenge while buidling speech recognition system. 

In this project, I build a CNN classifier to detect three different types of accent using keras, the input takes in a 128*173*4 png image data, and return what kinds of accents it predicted to be.
